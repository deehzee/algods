# AlgoDS - Data Structures, Algorithms and Problem Solving

This is a personal project to keep myself refreshed on data structures,
algorithms and problem solving.
Currently, the project is implemented in python, but in future I also plan
to implement in C++.

## Structure

* `algorithms`: Implementations of various algorithms.
* `datastructs`: Implementations of various data structures.
* `problems`: Solutions for various interview/competition problems.
* `pynotes`: Notes on some language features, tips and tricks of Python.
